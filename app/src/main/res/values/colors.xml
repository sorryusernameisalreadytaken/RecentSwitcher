    Define colour resources that automatically adapt to light and dark themes.
    The `recent_app_text_color` resource resolves to a dark text colour when
    running under a light theme and a light text colour when running under a
    dark theme. `recent_app_text_color_excluded` remains red in both themes.
    Additional colours can be added here as needed.

<resources>
    <!-- Default text colour for recent app entries in light mode (dark text on light background). -->
    <!-- Explicitly specify black to ensure good contrast on very light backgrounds. -->
    <color name="recent_app_text_color">#000000</color>
    <!-- Colour used for excluded apps; red draws attention regardless of theme. -->
    <color name="recent_app_text_color_excluded">#FF4444</color>
